# Pinmarker

[Pinmarker](http://kilovolt42.com/pinmarker) is a comfortable app for adding bookmarks to [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/). Use a clean native interface to enter tags and a description before posting. Easily post to multiple accounts without re-entering login information. Configure powerful workflows with other apps using flexible URL schemes.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to clone the project and install the required Cocoapods:

    git clone git@github.com:kilovolt42/Pinmarker.git
    cd Pinmarker
    pod install

Because this project uses CocoaPods you will need to open Pinmarker.xcworkspace, not Pinmarker.xcodeproj.

## Open Source

I decided to open source this app so I could easily show the code to potential employers, friends, and curious folks. Additionally, the extensibility features coming in iOS 8 will make the workflows of this app obsolete. Death to bookmarklets! All hail App Extensions! Although I may continue to fiddle with this project, I am much more interested in exploring the possibilities of Action and Share Extentions on both iOS and OS X.
